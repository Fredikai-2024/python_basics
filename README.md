Unit 8: Regular Expressions
At this point in the course, you should have some familiarity with applying string methods for finding a pattern within a string. Regular expressions are a syntax framework for performing more general pattern searches that allow for a measure of pattern variability. The subject of regular expressions is actually quite deep and highly relevant to the theory of computation. This unit will introduce you to the re module and its regular expression syntax to gain expertise with string pattern searches.

Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours. 

Unit 9: Exception Handling
Any programmer should be able to identify the source of potential errors and implement code to handle those errors. This unit introduces the syntax necessary for achieving this goal. Handling errors can be a sensitive topic because the programmer must address points where something could go wrong. Devote yourself to these examples, as they will be important in your journey to becoming a professional programmer.

Completing this unit should take you approximately 4 hours. 

Unit 10: Object-Oriented Programming
We are now ready to transition into object-oriented programming, which organizes code in the form of what are referred to as classes. In Python, every variable created is an object, and, as you have already seen, each variable has access to a set of methods. This is because there exists a class definition housing the methods that a given object has access to. In this unit, you will learn how to design your own classes, create or "instantiate" objects from a given class, and write programs that apply your class designs.
